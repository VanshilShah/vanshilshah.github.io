            {"type" : "text", "value" : "This means get started <b>today</b> on finding a summer job after first year, and try to get a part-time job during the school year. I worked part-time during first year for 10 hours a week doing Android development and while it is not necessary, getting experience early sets you up to dominate the job market later on. Working part-time can also be a great way to get your foot in the door, in my case, I was able to work at the same company after first year for a summer internship. For the bigger companies, your chances of getting an interview after 1st year are very low, and only possible after 2nd year if you have work experience. If you are in a co-op program or your school happens to be a <i>\"target school\"</i> for these companies, you will have better chances in securing an offer after 2nd year (I'm looking at you Waterloo students). Landing an interview as a 3rd year student is the most likely as companies are looking to convert summer interns into full-time employees after graduation. Everyone follows a different trajectory and there is no clearly marked path to these companies. Luck is also a major factor and as such, do not be discouraged if you get rejected the first <i>X</i> times. Until then, aim to get early experience in your reach, and build up your skills so you can ace the interview when the opportunity comes. The latter is an art form of its own and worthy of a seperate post about my learnings in this matter."},

            {"type" : "text", "value" : "Side projects look good on resumes, but they are also valuable because you build skills you do not learn in school. I have been working on side projects since high school and can not credit them enough. Not many people look at them this way but in my opinion they serve as opportunities to talk about your learnings with fellow programmers. To share a quick anecdotal example of this, I met the person who got me an interview at <b>Uber</b> when he looked to my screen and asked me about what I was working on. A good side project to get started with is building a personal website: you can build basic skills, learn to debug, and have a digital business card you can direct people towards to learn more about you. I began working on <b>vanshil.com</b> in 12th grade and have been regularly iterating it over the years. It has become so much a part of me that rather than needing to bring it up near the end of a conversation, it now precedes me and I often meet people who have seen my website before even meeting me."},
            {"type" : "text", "value" : "The <b><i>follow your heart</i></b> part of this point is to tell you it is ok to prioritize work that motivates you and maximizes your learning. When you get started in university, it is easy to become overwhelmed with the change and chase grades as you did in high school. While good grades can <i>potentially</i> help you secure an interview, average grades will not drag you down if you have built an impressive resume outside of school. The only exceptions to this are work opportunities that come from a school related career portal. However, if you are in software you will quickly learn that there are more (and probably better) opportunities outside of this gated community. This is <b>not an excuse</b> to fail school, my grades were far from failing when I was in school, but only to help you realize the lack of impact your GPA has on your career. I have only been asked about my GPA <b>once at a career fair</b> in my four years of going to career fairs and submitting job applications. Keep in mind however, if you are interested in any type of higher education beyond an undergrad, your GPA does matter and there is nothing wrong with making that a priority."},

The other two points in this post are advice commonly found online, but I see a minority of younger students following this last point. In my opinion it is probably the most important. My career path would not be the same if I had not made an impression on older students whom I met at hackathons or personally contacted. They were the people who referred me to big companies, answered all of my questions, vetted my resumes, and helped me prep for the interviews. Having heard many other people's stories, I now know that almost nobody makes it on their own. You need to be giving your 100% <b>and</b> seek help from those above you. I have never been turned down from asking for advice and have always left these encounters with more knowledge. On the flip side, everyone loves sharing advice and I have never felt it a chore to help those who reach out to me. When approached the right way and with respect for the other individual’s time, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by seeking guidance. You are going to meet a lot of new people in the next few months so take the time to ask yourself, \"What can I learn from this individual?\" Over time you will amass enough knowledge that you can pay it forward to the generation that follows you."}

You reach the front of the line, try to strike a conversation with the recruiter and pray they place your resume in the <b><i>\"potential candidates\"</i></b> pile instead of the <b><i>\"soon to be trashed\"</i></b> one. Career fairs can be a gold mine when it comes to personal development, yet to many people they can feel like a minefield. After attending many myself, I've learned what it means to be successful at a career fair and the steps you should take to stand out."},
            {"type" : "header", "value" : "1. Present yourself"},
            {"type" : "text", "value" : "Standing out from the crowd is critical to your success at a career fair. How you present yourself is a large part of this. You should obviously dress business casual and look presentable, but <b>presenting yourself extends beyond your attire and grooming</b>. You must adjust how you carry yourself, what you're carrying, and the persona you reflect. Whenever possible, carry only a binder or clipboard for your resume, and a paper and pen to write stuff down. Carrying less makes you feel more open and this will reflect in the way you communicate with others. The pen and paper are valuable to jot something down without losing the conversational momentum. Keeping your resume in your hand makes it easier for you or the recruiter to lead the conversation towards the end goal — the recruiter taking a look at your resume."},
            {"type" : "text", "value" : "Your resume stands as the ultimate presentation of your skills and it should be worth introducing into the conversation. If you're bringing up your resume (which you definitely should be doing), it should leave the recruiter with a better representation of you than your conversation with them. There's no point in spending 4 hours at a career fair handing out a resume that you only spent an hour writing. To stand out, a bizarre yet effective trick I often use is to print my resume on higher quality paper. Using premium paper can subconsciously affect how people look at your resume and the value they attach to it. You should still keep regular prints handy and only hand the high-quality ones to companies you feel will appreciate the extra effort. A good rule of thumb is to use the premium paper if you're handing the resume to a person, as it will be worth the reaction (believe me, they will have a reaction). Polishing your resume is <b>worth it</b>, but filling it is more important. The number one issue many undergrads face, is they don’t have enough to write about on their resume. Until you have enough work experience, it’s fair to write in detail about your side projects. Be sure to include technologies you used, features you implemented, and lessons you learned."},

            {"type" : "text", "value" : "Your one and only goal at a career fair should be to make other people remember you. Take some time to talk to the smaller companies attending, and if you can, talk to every company attending. The representatives will be nicer to you, listen more attentively, and are more likely to provide you with an opportunity. Remember, career fairs are for personal development. There's no harm in learning about companies in your industry, even if you're not interested in working there. Having this general awareness will help you converse better with those in the same field as you. Small companies also serve as great conversation practice, where you can perfect how to talk about yourself and your experience. It's natural to feel shy at career fairs, you’re in a large open space surrounded by people who seem to be more interesting than you. The only way to overcome this shyness and become your most presentable self is to engage in conversations."},

Additionally, it requires them to take a closer look at your resume and perhaps notice something they earlier hadn’t. One of the critical ingredients to becoming an expert in any subject is rapid feedback. There’s no better place than a career fair to collect this feedback on your career-building skills."},
            {"type" : "header", "value" : "3. Ask the right questions"},
            {"type" : "text", "value" : "We've established that conversations are important at career fairs, but what should you talk about? Recruiters are always being asked questions, so focus on asking those that matter, and make you stand out. My favourite question to ask tech companies is: <b><i>\"What technologies do you guys work with?\"</i></b> Any recruiter will know to list the frameworks and languages they are looking for and this helps you better understand how to advertise yourself to that company. If you're lucky enough to be speaking with somebody technically inclined, you can respond to their answer with: <b><i>\"Oh, you work with X technology? I recently used that for a project I built that does Y. I found it to be very powerful for A, B and C but the learning curve for D was very challenging.\"</i></b> This simple pattern initiates an engaging conversation, while subtly advertising your skills as a programmer."},
            {"type" : "text", "value" : "For larger tech companies, they'll generally have work opportunities for all sorts of languages so the same pattern might not fare as well. Instead, when you get to the front of the line, it's worth getting straight to the point. Introduce yourself, explain what type of position you're looking for, and your experience until this point. Next, ask the recruiter what their company is looking for. If you fit their needs, it's as simple as handing them your resume and pointing out where you meet the criteria. Usually, the recruiter will highlight those relevant areas and hold on to the resume. Truthfully, I've only ever seen students who exactly fit the criteria move forward with a large tech company from a career fair. Most times, it's not worth your time to approach these companies at a career fair, and they will likely tell you to apply online anyway."},
            {"type" : "text", "value" : "Your measure of success at a career fair shouldn’t only be the impressions you left on people but also the impressions they left on you. There is a lot to learn from other people in your industry, and when you approach these events as a learning opportunity your success is assured."},
