    <meta property='og:description' content="We have all been there. Standing in a 10 person line for the Amazon booth at a campus career fair. You get to the front of the line in hopes of striking a conversation with the recruiter and praying that they ask for your resume and put it in the <b><i>"potential candidates"</b></i> pile instead of the <b><i>"soon to be trashed"</b></i> one (if you did not know they did this, well now you know). Career fairs can be a gold mine when it comes to personal development, yet to many they can feel like a minefield. Having attended many myself I have learned what it means to be successful at a career fair, and the steps you should take to get there./>
