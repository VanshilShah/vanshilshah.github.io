                   I am really enjoying the new pace for CSC148. Last semester I found 108 to be rather simple and am glad that I am being pushed more in this year's course. Last week's tutorial slightly more difficult than I expected. I think that I was slightly unprepared but I will be more prepared next week. I am really excited to see where this course takes me! - Jan 27th, 2016

CSC148 is feeling alright now. I am much more used to the schedule and doing the labs ahead of time makes it much easier for me to do well in the quizzes. I lost a lot of marks on the midterm for running out of time to do the docstrings. So I've practiced doing doc strings over the few weeks it has been. I find myself being able to write them much faster without thinking too much about them. The 1st assignment was tricky and I actually missed out on some of the actions that needed to occur at specific events. Thankfully I caught them before submitting. I fixed my average calculations minutes before the deadline. I hope I did well on the assignment.

Wow, I am feeling much more relieved about this course. I got a perfect on the last test and it was because of the practice I did for it. I found that past tests are the most helpful for me to practice my skill in python. I really enjoyed writing Assignment 2 as well because it gave me a chance to apply everything that I learned in class. I'll be honest figuring out the BFS and DFS algorithms was tricky, especially when the problem sometimes was caused by extensions not working, rather than the BFS and DFS algorithms themselves. I also spent a lot of time trying to debug my code by printing the puzzles every iteration of the DFS algorithm, but infact that was the only reason my DFS wasn't working. It turned out that printing a puzzle at every iteration slowed my real running time by a factor of 10. I thought I had an endless loop but really, it was just taking like 5 minutes to run and complete. Lesson Learned. I will always think twice before using a print statement to debug code in the future. In other news, I did some calculations and it turns out that due to my recent test mark, I am expected clear the minumin 74% average by a significant margin. This relieves me because there is less stress for me about getting into the CS Specialist POST. I will also try and send in my application or the POST as soon as possible, as I know that the appplications open up on April 1st. CSC148 has been a fun ride, and I really like the way that it was taught, and more importantly the assignments. Sometimes in 108 i felt that the assignment wasn't reall related to CS as much as it was just basic syntax and stuff. 148 really packs a punch when it comes to problem solving.</p>
