                   I am really enjoying the new pace for CSC148. Last semester I found 108 to be rather simple and am glad that I am being pushed more in this year's course. Last week's tutorial slightly more difficult than I expected. I think that I was slightly unprepared but I will be more prepared next week. I am really excited to see where this course takes me! - Jan 27th, 2016

CSC148 is feeling alright now. I am much more used to the schedule and doing the labs ahead of time makes it much easier for me to do well in the quizzes. I lost a lot of marks on the midterm for running out of time to do the docstrings. So I've practiced doing doc strings over the few weeks it has been. I find myself being able to write them much faster without thinking too much about them. The 1st assignment was tricky and I actually missed out on some of the actions that needed to occur at specific events. Thankfully I caught them before submitting. I fixed my average calculations minutes before the deadline. I hope I did well on the assignment.
